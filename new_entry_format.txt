Name of metal power - AlSi10Mg here
Lower bound of power range = 100W from our decision
Upper bound of power range = 400W from our decision
Size of intervals of power = 100W from our decision
Lower bound of speed range = 750 from our decision
Upper bound of speed range = 2250 from our decision
Size of intervals of speed = 750 from our decision
Proportionality constant = 0.49 from [1] p.7 table 3 (determined by Grossman et al. by regression analysis).
Material density = 2670 from [1] p.4 table 2 | 2690-0.19*(current_temp-293.15) from [3] - I have chosen 2670
Specific heat capacity = 910 from [1] p.4 table 2 | 536.1+0.035*current_temp from [3] - I have chosen 910. Please note this value (belonging to Grossman) did account for changes in temperature to some extent by using an effective specific heat capacity value, not a specific heat capacity value.
Initial temperature = 298K from assuming that the metal powder is initially is at room temperature
Melting temperature = 870K from [1] p.4 table 2. | 867K from [3] - I have chosen 870K
Conductivity = 140 from [2] p.3 table 1 | 113+1.06*(10^-5)*current_temp from [3] - I chosen 140
Solidus temperature (this is the temperature below which an alloy is completely solid, no liquid at all) = 830.15K from [2] p.3 table 1 - I have chosen 830.15K
Plate temperature = 298K from assuming it's standard room temperature
Heat of fusion (energy for converting 1kg solid to liquid) = 476500 from [2] p.3 table 1 | 5.03*10^5 from [3] - I have chosen 476500
Absorptivity of the metal = 0.32 from [2] p.3 table 1 | No Absorptivity yet from us, is minimum sbsorptivity the same? - I have chosen 0.32
Thermal diffusivity = conductivity/(rho*cp) (which is a standard equation) | 4.5*10^-5 from [3] - I have decided to use the standard equation because while it is more proper to use an experimental value which is the theoretical naturally adjusted by unaccounted factors, there was no indication that a thermal diffusivity experimental value was used. I could be wrong and we could check.
Laser beam diameter = varies. It's typically 100 micrometres, 75 micrometres, 50 micrometres etc. on these machines
Melt pool depth coefficient = 5.9 from [2] p.4 table 4. (determined by Grossman et al. by experiments)
